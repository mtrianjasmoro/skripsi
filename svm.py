<h1>Welcome to Colaboratory!</h1>


Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud.

With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser.

"""## Getting Started

The document you are reading is a  [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/), hosted in Colaboratory. It is not a static page, but an interactive environment that lets you write and execute code in Python and other languages.

For example, here is a **code cell** with a short Python script that computes a value, stores it in a variable, and prints the result:
"""

seconds_in_a_day = 24 * 60 * 60
seconds_in_a_day

"""To execute the code in the above cell, select it with a click and then either press the play button to the left of the code, or use the keyboard shortcut "Command/Ctrl+Enter".

All cells modify the same global state, so variables that you define by executing a cell can be used in other cells:
"""

seconds_in_a_week = 7 * seconds_in_a_day
seconds_in_a_week
